# Lombiq UI Testing Toolbox



## About

Web UI testing toolbox mostly for Orchard Core applications. Everything you need to do UI testing for an Orchard app is here.

Highlights:

- Execute fully self-contained, repeatable, parallelizable automated UI tests on Orchard Core apps.
- Do cross-browser testing with all current browsers, both in normal and headless modes.
- Check the HTML structure and behavior of the app, check for errors in the Orchard logs and browser logs. Start troubleshooting from the detailed full application dumps if a test fails.
- Start tests with a setup using recipes, start with an existing Orchard app or take snapshots in between tests and resume from there.
- Test e-mail sending with a local SMTP server too. Everything just works.
- Check for web content accessibility so people with disabilities can user your app properly too. You can also create accessibility reports for all pages.
- Reliability is built in, so you won't get false negatives.
